# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle
.ruby-gemset

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*

# Ignore uploaded files in development
/storage/*

.byebug_history
rspec.xml

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key
